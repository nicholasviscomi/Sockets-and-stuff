Idea #1:
    Client connects to the server and gets the initial message (done)
    From there, the client can make requests for new data (similar to web browser I think) (done)
    Use SQL so the people that connect to the server can get, set, post data
        (i.e. GET nicholasviscomi --> returns fake data about me)

Idea #2 (using):
    Multithreaded server (done)
    Client gets sent what port number (acts as username) they are (maybe encrypt this so it is guaranteed to be unique?)
    From there they are asked what other client they would like to connect to
    The client they request to chat with will get an invitation they can accept or decline
    From there, those two users can chat freely (done minus some error handling, the use usually has to rerun the program in case of an error)

    Create a GUI
    Be able to send files
    Groupchats
